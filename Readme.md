Tacape Tools
============

This is a work in progrees, I would wait until I have the testing suite implemented to publish this but time is slipping away from me, maybe you can help!

Just fork, add your tool, and make a pull request.

You can test your tools locally just throwing them at the `~/.tacape/tools` folder.

Take a look at the code of the tools already implemented.

All I did was to get the code of scripts I made for myself and put them togheter in a better organized way, this is not the kind of code you should publish, but I believe this is gonna force me to make it better.

Have fun!
